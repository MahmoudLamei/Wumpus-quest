-----------------

Very good, your agent manages environment 4. which gives you 70 points for the solution. 

However, what we expect from the readme is explanations of how you solved the problem, not just a description of the problem. Currently, there's more description of the problem, and only basic level explanations for the solution. The documentation part gives you 18 points.

Overall Score: 70 + 18 = 88 points.
